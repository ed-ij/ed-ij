- 👋 Hi, I’m @ed-ij
- 👀 I’m interested in using technology to improve the planet, specifically by combatting carbon emmisions and reducing human impact on the environment. I started out in industrial engineering and realised that wasn't how I wanted to use my career, I'm still working on how I can best do this and what skills I should focus on developing. I'm also interested in cameras, video, drones, old tech and new tech. I love the outdoors and spending time in nature, usually by hiking, camping and/or climbing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about conservation and Ethical Altruism (EA). I'm also working on my creative skills by watching lots of adventure/community
     documentaries and through building a portfolio of my own work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting and impactful projects, I am open to anything that might fit into my interests, even if not directly. I am currently working on a project to make 8mm cameras digital - without losing their charm! Hopefully this might stop a few going into landfill and will at the least give me a way to record memories without taking a whole bag of camera equipment with me everywhere I go.
